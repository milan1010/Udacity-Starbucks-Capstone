# Udacity-Starbucks-Capstone
## Project Description
In the capstone project of the Udacity Data Scientist nanodegree program, Udacity in collaboration with Starbucks has provided a simulated dataset which involves user information, past transaction details along with promotional offer details sent out to the users. As a student we are required to make a recommendation engine to help Starbucks maximize their profits by helping them decide which offers they should send to a particular user!
In this project, I analyzed and cleaned the datasets provided, did exploratory analysis and then made a recommendation model to predict the best offers for a given user using Funk SVD.

Aim: To develop a model that returns the offers which a given user is most likely to complete so as to maxmimize profit for Starbucks.

## The Dataset
The data is contained in three files:

1. portfolio.json — containing offer ids and meta data about each offer (duration, type, etc.)

2. profile.json — demographic data for each customer

3. transcript.json — records for transactions, offers received, offers viewed, and offers completed

## Installation

- pandas
- numpy
- math
- json

In this project the following was done:
- Analyze the given datasets.
- Clean the datasets.
- Develop a model for recommending offers.
- Train and validate the model.
- Make recommendations to Starbucks for the best possible offers to users.
